**Some of the Design Decisions and there justifications are:- **

1.	Increased Word Spacing:- The space character width was increased to provide more separation between words.

Justification: Dyslexic readers often struggle with crowding effects, where letters and words seem to merge together. By increasing the word spacing, this font help the reader distinguish between words more clearly, improving reading flow and comprehension. 

2.	Larger X-Height:- The font has a larger x-height (the height of lowercase letters like "a," "e," "o").

Justification: Dyslexic children may find it easier to read fonts with taller lowercase letters, as it makes each character more distinct. Larger x-heights improve the legibility of lowercase text, which is commonly used in reading materials.

3.	Distinct Letterforms:- Characters that are easily confused (like "b" and "d," or "p" and "q") were modified to have more distinct shapes.

Justification: Dyslexic readers may struggle with letter reversals and mirror imaging, which can cause confusion. By making similar-looking letters more visually distinct, the font helps prevent these errors and facilitates easier reading.

4.	Heavier Baseline:- Letters have a slightly heavier stroke at the bottom of each character (stronger baseline).

Justification: This design choice provides visual stability, anchoring the letters and making them easier to follow along the line. This helps dyslexic readers maintain focus and reduces the likelihood of skipping or misreading words.

5.	Generous Character Spacing:- The space between individual characters (letter spacing or kerning) was increased slightly.

Justification: By spacing letters farther apart, we reduce the crowding effect that can overwhelm dyslexic readers. Generous character spacing allows for clearer differentiation between letters, improving reading speed and accuracy.

6.	Simple, Rounded Shapes:- Letters have more rounded, clean shapes without unnecessary flourishes or sharp angles.

Justification: Simple, rounded shapes are easier for young readers to recognize and distinguish. Complex shapes or decorative fonts can add cognitive load, making reading more difficult for dyslexic individuals. Rounded shapes are friendly and approachable, especially for children.

7.	High Contrast Between Letters and Background:- The font is designed to be clear and legible with high contrast, ensuring readability on both light and dark backgrounds.

Justification: High contrast is crucial for dyslexic readers, as low contrast between text and background can make reading more difficult.
